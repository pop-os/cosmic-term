# cosmic-term
WIP COSMIC terminal emulator, built using [alacritty\_terminal](https://docs.rs/alacritty_terminal) that is provided by the [alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) project. `cosmic-term` provides bidirectional rendering and ligatures with a custom renderer based on [cosmic-text](https://github.com/pop-os/cosmic-text).

The `wgpu` feature, enabled by default, supports GPU rendering using `glyphon`
and `wgpu`. If `wgpu` is not enabled or fails to initialize, then rendering falls
back to using `softbuffer` and `tiny-skia`.
